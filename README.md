This is a currency converter project.I utilized HTML,CSS and JavaScript to create a robust and interactive web application.
The goal was to design a tool that allows users to seamlessly convert between different currencies with a clean and intuitive interface.
The foundation of the project is built with HTML, which provides the essential structure for the application.
CSS was crucial in styling the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. 
JavaScript is the backbone of the application's functionality, making it interactive and dynamic.
